## Introducing nanOS

At WWDC, Apple introduces new ways to experience familiar devices.

**nanOS** is a design exploration that imagines the iPod nano continuing into the **iOS 26 era**, redesigned with **Liquid Glass**, fluid depth, and modern Apple UI principles — all distilled down to a device that fits in the palm of your hand.

It’s not about adding more.  
It’s about refining what’s already there.

## ✨ Features

- Liquid Glass–inspired interface  
- Light & Dark appearances  
- Modernised icons and typography  
- Subtle translucency, blur, and refraction  
- Designed specifically for the iPod nano 7th gen display  
- Faithful to Apple’s content-first design philosophy  

---

## 📱 Supported Device

- **iPod nano (7th generation)**

> nanOS is not a real operating system.  
> It is a **custom UI theme / visual concept** created for design exploration and personalisation.

---

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

nanOS takes inspiration from:
- **iOS 26**
- **Liquid Glass**
- **visionOS depth and translucency**
- Apple Human Interface Guidelines

The goal is simple:

**What if iPod nano never stopped evolving?**

## 🛠 Installation

Installation methods depend on how the theme is applied  
(asset replacement, custom firmware, or UI mockups).
