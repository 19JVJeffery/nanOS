# nanOS

**nanOS** is a custom UI theme for the **iPod nano (7th generation)**, inspired by **iOS 26** and Apple’s new **Liquid Glass** design language.

It reimagines the iPod nano interface with fluid translucency, soft depth, and modern Apple-style visuals — while respecting the hardware’s original limitations.
